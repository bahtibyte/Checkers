### Notes
- Working on the search tab was challenging because I had trouble hiding the keyboard when a movie was selected. When adding a new gesture for the collection view, it overrided its past gestures and it didnt detect tapping. I overcame the problem by hiding the keyboard when a movie is chosen.
